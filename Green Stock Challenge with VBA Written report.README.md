# Green Stock Challenge with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

   The purpose of this challenge is to make a financial model made for Steve to analyze the stock market. 
Being able to look at all the stocks at once makes it apparent who is preforming and who is flopping. 
This is a great tool that he can show his parents the right stocks to invest in. 

## Analysis and Challenges

    Refactoring the code is a key to making the code run efficiently. 
Clean code makes the time it takes to run the VBA module shorter making Steve more productive.
The less time he must spend on waiting for his code to run the more time he has to do other things he finds important. 

With only 12 tickers this is not an issue, but when analyzing thousands of stocks, it could take a long time to run the VBA Code. 

-Stock Performance 

 When looking at the stock performance we can see the stocks for 2017 performed very well with the stock ticker of “DQ” at 199.4% I would suggest finding out why this stock is doing so well and possibly invest. Many stocks have earning potential 

When looking at 2018 stocks we see that there are many stocks performing poorly overall but both “RUN” at 84% and “ENPH” at 81.9% have strong returns that could be worth looking into.   

### Analysis of 2017 stock performance

-Execution time for original script 

The original 2017 script ran in 1.4 seconds.

-Execution time for refactored script 

The refactored 2017 script ran in 0.18 seconds.

### Analysis of 2018 stock performance
-Execution time for original script 

The original 2018 script ran in 1.1 seconds 

-Execution time for refactored script

The refactored 2018 script ran in 0.17 seconds. 

## Summary for the following questions 

### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

-Advantages of refactoring code in General

Code refactoring reduces the number of errors there will be later. If there are going to be updates to the code, they will have an easier time reading and preforming the update. 

There can be increased readability of the code making coworkers or clints using the code more informed 
-Disadvantages of refactoring code in General

If someone were to refactor the code without knowing the ins and out of it there could be aspects lost in the process. 


### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

-Advantages of the original and refactored VBA script

The advantages are that the code is properly structured and easy to read. If Steve wants to see how this program was ran, he will be able to see the code headers showing what the code does. Refactoring also speeds up the code making the experience faster when analyzing stocks. 

-Disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script


If Steve helped build this report and it was refactored, it could confuse him. We want to make the code as clear as possible and changing the structure might be detrimental to users of the old code and that are unfamiliar with the refactored code.
